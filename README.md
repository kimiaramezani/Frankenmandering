# Frankenmandering

The spread of opinions in social networks has traditionally been examined from two perspectives: altering the network’s topology or strategically placing “influencers” within it. Social network administrators typically control the former approach, while the latter operates more as an open market. Both strategies, however, are difficult to implement effectively, though not impossible.

In district-based electoral systems, political actors have instead resorted to another controversial tactic: gerrymandering-redrawing voter boundaries to distort election outcomes. This practice has been explored both in applied political contexts and in theoretical studies. Interestingly, gerrymandering has generally been treated as a one-time manipulation of existing voter preferences, rather than as a mechanism to both shape and exploit opinions. This is surprising, given that some research has already examined its long-term political consequences, and that the idea of grouping individuals to influence their opinions in election settings has been raised. 

In this project, we extend this line of inquiry by demonstrating that gerrymandering can serve as a powerful tool for opinion formation with lasting electoral consequences. Specifically, we argue that gerrymandering inherently involves restructuring social opinion networks, which makes it viable as a long-term method of opinion control. We refer to this repeated application of gerrymandering to shape opinion dynamics within social networks as “Frankenmandering.”

We implement the ideas of the uploaded papers in the [Reference Papers](https://github.com/kimiaramezani/Frankenmandering/tree/a7266aea55addbf155c084ad0485f4fe0c37e9ef/Reference%20Papers) together to improve the gerrymandering problem.
